    "## Business context\n",
    "NovaPay is a digital-first cross-border money transfer company headquartered in Toronto with operations across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. It enables customers to send, receive, and hold multiple currencies with a strong focus on affordability, speed, and a seamless digital experience. Secure transaction processing is central to NovaPay’s customer trust, operational performance, and regulatory standing, making early and accurate fraud detection a strategic priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fraud environment: key risks\n",
    "NovaPay’s fraud environment reflects common digital payments threats, amplified by cross-border complexity and real-time expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identity theft & account takeover (ATO):** attackers compromise accounts (phishing, credential stuffing, SIM-swap) and initiate unauthorized transfers.\n",
    "- **Unauthorized payments:** fraudulent transactions initiated without legitimate customer intent.\n",
    "- **Transaction laundering / mule networks:** illicit funds routed through chains of accounts and corridors to obscure origin and destination.\n",
    "- **Device/IP abuse:** suspicious IPs, new devices, and mismatches between declared location and observed IP geography.\n",
    "- **Velocity anomalies:** bursts of activity over short windows (e.g., 1h/24h transaction velocity) suggesting automation or laundering.\n",
    "- **Cross-border corridor risk:** certain routes/currency corridors may have elevated risk due to fraud concentration, weaker verification, or known mule flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operational and regulatory constraints\n",
    "Fraud controls must operate under tight constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-time processing:** transactions may need instant approval/decline decisions, limiting manual review.\n",
    "- **Rules-based limits:** static rules can become outdated and are vulnerable to adaptive fraud tactics.\n",
    "- **False positives:** blocking legitimate users harms experience and can increase churn.\n",
    "- **Compliance expectations:** AML and KYC requirements mean decisions should be **auditable and explainable**, especially for high-impact declines and account restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and modelling implications (early risks)\n",
    "Fraud detection performance depends heavily on data and labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Label reliability:** fraud labels may come from investigations, chargebacks, or disputes, which can be delayed or incomplete.\n",
    "- **Class imbalance:** fraud is typically rare in production. Models must handle imbalance so they do not default to predicting “non-fraud.”\n",
    "- **Bias/fairness risk:** features tied to geography, KYC tiers, IP risk, and internal scores can produce uneven outcomes across segments. We must monitor error rates (false positives/false negatives) across meaningful groups (e.g., corridor, home country, KYC tier) and ensure legitimate users are not disproportionately impacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success criteria (what “good” looks like)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business success\n",
    "A successful solution should:\n",
    "1. **Reduce fraud losses** by catching more fraud earlier.\n",
    "2. **Lower operational burden** by prioritizing the highest-risk cases for review.\n",
    "3. **Protect customer experience** by keeping false positives manageable.\n",
    "4. **Support compliance** via transparent, auditable, explainable decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model success (technical KPIs)\n",
    "The model should:\n",
    "- Improve **fraud recall** versus a baseline (rules/manual process), while controlling alert volume.\n",
    "- Balance **precision vs recall** to prevent analyst overload.\n",
    "- Report **Recall, Precision, F1, PR-AUC** (especially important for imbalanced fraud labels).\n",
    "- Provide **transaction-level explainability** (e.g., SHAP) to show why a transaction was flagged.\n",
    "- Be designed for deployment (FastAPI scoring service) as a step toward real-time production scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 1 deliverables mapping\n",
    "- **Day 1:** Fraud environment + success criteria (this document)\n",
    "- **Day 2:** Data assessment report (schema, imbalance, bias risks, label reliability)\n",
    "- **Day 3:** Cleaning pipeline + cleaned dataset + cleaning notes\n",
    "- **Day 4:** Engineered features + EDA visuals and comparisons fraud vs non-fraud\n",
    "- **Day 5:** Feature set finalized and ready for modelling (documentation included)"
